[Dowload link (.zip file)](http://www.java2s.com/Open-Source/CSharp_Free_Code/Windows_Presentation_Foundation_Library/Download_Fotofly_Photo_Metadata_Library.htm) is at the end of the page.

NOTES:
This is ported to .NET core 3.0
BingMapResolver.cs has issues, so excluded it from project and commented corresponding code

Alternatively one can [Add metadata to image blobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/tutorials/storage-lab-tutorial?WT.mc_id=aiml-0000-ayyonet)
